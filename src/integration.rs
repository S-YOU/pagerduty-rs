//! Integration API
//!
//! The PagerDuty event integration API is how you would add PagerDuty's advanced alerting
//! functionality to any system that can make an HTTP API call. You can now add phone, SMS and email
//! alerting to your monitoring tools, ticketing systems and custom software.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The API was designed to allow you to easily integrate a monitoring system with a Service in
//! PagerDuty. Monitoring systems generally send out events when problems are detected and when
//! these problems have been resolved (fixed). Some more advanced systems also understand the
//! concept of acknowledgements: problems can be acknowledged by an engineer to signal he or she is
//! working on fixing the issue.
//!
//! Since monitoring systems emit events, the API is based around accepting events. Incoming events
//! (sent via the API) are routed to a PagerDuty service and processed. They may result in a new
//! incident being created, or an existing incident being acknowledged or resolved.
//!
//! The same event-based API can also be used to integrate a PagerDuty service with ticketing
//! systems and various other software tools.
//!
//! # API Limits
//!
//! There is a limit on the number of events that a service can accept at any given time. Depending
//! on the behavior of the incoming traffic and how many incidents are being created at once, we
//! reduce our throttle dynamically.
//!
//! If each of the events your monitoring system is sending is important, be sure to retry on a 403
//! response code, preferably with a back off.
//!
//! # Response codes and Retry Logic
//!
//! Ideally, the API request will succeed and the PagerDuty server will indicate that it
//! successfully received that event. In practice, the request may fail due to various reasons.
//!
//! The following table shows the possible results of the API request and if you need to retry the
//! API call for that result:
//!
//! | Result           | Description                                                                                   | Retry?                       |
//! |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
//! | 200              | OK - The event has been accepted by PagerDuty. See below for details.                         | No                           |
//! | 400              | Bad Request - Check that the JSON is valid. See below for details.                            | No                           |
//! | 403              | Forbidden - Too many API calls at a time.                                                     | Yes - retry after some time. |
//! | 5xx              | Internal Server Error - the PagerDuty server experienced an error while processing the event. | Yes - retry after some time. |
//! | Networking Error | Error while trying to communicate with PagerDuty servers.                                     | Yes - retry after some time. |
